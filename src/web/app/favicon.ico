1. Use an icon editor or image editing software that supports ICO format export 
   (e.g., Adobe Photoshop with ICO plugin, GIMP, or dedicated icon editors)

2. Create icon with the following specifications:
   - Format: ICO (Windows Icon)
   - Include both required sizes: 16x16 and 32x32 pixels
   - Color profile: RGB
   - Primary brand color: #0F172A
   - Background: Transparent
   - Design should be simple and recognizable at small sizes

3. Export settings:
   - Save as .ico format
   - Ensure multiple resolutions are embedded (16x16, 32x32)
   - Verify transparency is preserved
   - Confirm color accuracy of #0F172A

4. Place the generated favicon.ico file at:
   src/web/app/favicon.ico

5. Validation steps:
   - Test favicon in multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
   - Verify appearance in browser tabs
   - Check display in bookmarks
   - Confirm visibility in desktop shortcuts
   - Validate both 16x16 and 32x32 resolutions are included using an ICO file inspector
